Ask for variables
* Ask for hill type (int)
   * Could be easiest to say type 1 for normal, type 2 for large
   * Error check make sure its one of these options
* Ask for speed at the end of the ramp (double)


Use hill type to find height (int)
* Normal → 46 meters
* Large → 70 meters
Also use hill type to find points per meter (float) and par(int)
* Store these in a variable


Store height in a variable


Calculate time in air (double)
* sqrt((2*height)/9.8)


Calculate distance traveled (double)
* Speed * time in air 


Calculate points earned
* 60 + (distance - par)*points_per_meter


Create if statements for print out statement
* If points >= 61 → “great job”
* If points < 10 → “what happened”
* Else → “sorry man”


Then print their distance and points
